# Lead Quality Analysis Challenge

This project was completed as part of a data analysis challenge for a selection process. The dataset contained around 3,000 leads acquired from a single publisher (multiple referring domains) and sent to a single advertiser. The goal was to analyze lead quality based on their final disposition.

## 🧾 Dataset Overview
- Each row = 1 lead
- Includes traffic source (referring domain) and final outcome (`Disposition`)
- Objective: Understand patterns in lead quality and what influences successful conversions

## 🔍 Analysis Performed
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Segment-wise lead quality comparison
- Insights into traffic sources and lead outcomes
- Power BI dashboard for interactive visualization

## 📊 Tools Used
- Python (pandas, matplotlib/seaborn)
- SQL (optional if used)
- Power BI

## 📎 Files
- `notebooks/analysis.ipynb`: Python code and visualizations
- `reports/lead_quality_summary.pdf`: PDF summary of insights
- `visuals/powerbi_dashboard.png`: Power BI snapshot

## 🚀 Key Insights
- Some referring domains consistently delivered higher quality leads
- Disposition patterns suggested possible issues in initial filtering
- Clear drop-off trends observed in certain lead types

## 📌 Note
This repository was created to demonstrate my ability to work with real-world business datasets, apply analytical thinking, and present data-driven insights in both visual and written formats.
